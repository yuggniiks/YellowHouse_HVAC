Of course! A good README.md file is essential for any GitHub project. Based on our conversation and the features we've built together, here is a comprehensive README.md file you can use.

Just copy and paste the text below into a file named README.md in your GitHub repository.

YellowHouse HVAC Decision Analysis Tool
This project is a comprehensive, browser-based tool designed to help homeowners analyze and compare HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) replacement options. It provides detailed financial analysis for standard air-to-air heat pumps, hybrid geothermal, and full geothermal systems, empowering users to make informed decisions based on their specific quotes and financial parameters.

The entire analysis runs directly in your web browser, requiring no server or special setup.

‚ú® Key Features
This tool goes beyond simple cost comparisons by offering a dynamic and interactive analysis framework.

Three-Tier System Comparison: Analyze quotes across three distinct categories:

üîß Heat Pump Options: Standard replacements for a broken unit.

üîÑ Hybrid Geothermal: A phased approach installing ground loops with a single new unit, preparing the home for a future full-system upgrade.

‚ö° Full Geothermal: A complete, premium replacement of the entire HVAC system.

Interactive 30-Year Cost Projection:

Visualize the cumulative cost (initial investment + energy + maintenance) over 30 years.

Toggle individual options on or off to easily compare specific scenarios.

A vertical line automatically appears showing the payback/break-even point where a geothermal option becomes more cost-effective than the selected heat pump baseline.

Selectable Comparison Baseline: Don't just compare against the cheapest option. A dropdown menu allows you to choose which heat pump quote to use as the baseline for all geothermal payback and NPV calculations.

In-Depth Financial Metrics:

Net Present Value (NPV): See the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year value of choosing an upgraded system over the baseline.

Simple Payback: Calculates how long it will take for energy savings to cover the extra investment for geothermal options.

Tax Credit Analysis: Automatically applies the federal tax credit for geothermal systems to the cost analysis.

Data Management:

Load Vendor Data: Import all your quotes at once from a CSV or TXT file.

Save Vendor Data: Export your current analysis to a CSV file to save your work.

Download Template: Get a blank CSV template to easily fill in your vendor quotes.

Customizable Parameters: Adjust key variables to match your situation, including electricity rates, inflation, maintenance costs, and system lifespans.

üöÄ How to Use
Download the Repository: Download the project files from GitHub as a ZIP file and unzip them on your computer.

Open the Tool: Simply double-click the index.html file to open the analysis tool in your default web browser.

Enter Your Data:

Adjust the Financial Parameters and Current System details to match your home and local utility rates.

Use the "‚ûï Add ... Quote" buttons to manually enter the details for each quote you have received.

Alternatively, use the "üìÅ Load Vendor File" button to import your quotes from a CSV file. You can use the "üìã Get Blank Template" button to see the required format.

Analyze the Results:

Step 1 Table: Compare the baseline heat pump options. Use the dropdown menu right below the title to select which of these will be the baseline for all other comparisons.

Step 2 & 3 Tables: See the extra investment, net cost after tax credits, and simple payback period for your hybrid and full geothermal options compared to your selected baseline.

NPV Table: Review the long-term financial viability of each upgrade option. Green values are favorable.

30-Year Projection Chart: Use the interactive toggles to compare the long-term cumulative costs. Watch for the crossover points where the lines intersect to see when an investment pays off.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
Frontend: The entire tool is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Charting: The 30-year projection graph is rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API.

No Dependencies: This project uses no external libraries or frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to run offline.

Serverless: No web server is needed. All logic runs client-side in your browser.
