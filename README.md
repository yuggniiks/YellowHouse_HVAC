## ü§î Why Use This Tool?

Choosing a new HVAC system is a major financial decision. Comparing quotes is difficult when they involve different upfront costs, efficiencies (SEER2, HSPF2, EER, COP), lifespans, and tax credits. This tool cuts through the noise by providing a clear, apples-to-apples financial comparison based on your specific quotes and financial parameters, helping you see the true long-term cost of each option.
